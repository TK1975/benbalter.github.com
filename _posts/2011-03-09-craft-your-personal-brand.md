I gave a brief talk at March's joint [WordPressDC and Hacks/Hackers DC MeetUp](http://www.meetup.com/wordpressdc/events/16178194/) on leveraging WordPress to craft your personal brand. Below are slides and a recording of the livestream.

**I invite you to watch, but in short, the main takeaways were:**

*   ![Why Brand?](http://ben.balter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/branding-300x224.png "Why Brand?")In the olden days, people used to be scared to put personal information online; they felt the need to be pseudonymous (*see* handles like SparklePrincess87); life online was distinct from life offline.
*   As more of our analog lives became digital, the need for a second identity diminished; we no longer represent ourselves with anonymous screen names, but rather as ourselves.
*   Social networking and mobile computing contributed to this shift by interfacing the online and offline worlds. Today's radical transparency (*e.g.,* lifecasters posting pictures of their lunch) shows we have come a full 180.
*   We shift from corporate brand associations in the 50s (*e.g.,* "I work for IBM") to personal brands today (*e.g.,* "I'm an independent contractor").
*   Today we all have a unique opportunity to plant a flag on our corner of the internet, take control of our online identity, and declare to the world who we are by crafting a thought-out narrative.
*   Unlike in the real world where you are the only one in control of what you say, online, content has a life of its own â€” you must be proactive.
*   WordPress makes it dumb simple to tell the world your story.

**My five big steps to launching your brand:**

1.  Grab a domain
2.  Define your personal brand
3.  Start a blog
4.  Socialize your content
5.  Upgrade your resume
