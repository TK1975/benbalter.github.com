I've written before about how we should treat [prose and data with the same respect that developers treat code](http://ben.balter.com/2013/09/16/treat-data-as-code/) and how [Jekyll forces you to do just that](http://ben.balter.com/2013/10/30/content-is-king/), but there's another workflow that version-controlled, collaborative content enables: continuous integration.

*Continuous integration* (CI) is the idea that for every change, whether proposed or realized, a standard battery of tests run, to confirm the change does what you intend it to do. In most developer tools, like GitHub, you get instant feedback, in the form of a green light, to let you know that that is in fact the case, or a red light, in the event that something went awry, detailing exactly what doesn't match you specified expectations.

When you treat content as code, you get the opportunity to co-opt best-of-breed developer workflows, and continuous integration is no exception. We've all been there. You make a simple change and end up breaking two or three other things. Links get out of date. Images move. Imagine if every time you made a change, all those things that you consciously or subconsciously worry about were automatically checked. Are my links accurate? Did any of my images break? Does this darn thing actually render the way I want it to?

With CI services like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), whether public or private, adding continuous integration to a repository of prose content, whether an entire website or a collection of HTML or Markdown files becomes trivial, especially when you use open source tools like [HTML Proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer).

### Checking links and images

Let's say you have a Jekyll site, versioned on GitHub, and published on GitHub Pages, and you'd, like Travis to give your content a quick checkup, every time you make a change. First, you'll want to add the following to your site's `Gemfile`:

{% highlight ruby %}
group :test do
  gem 'html-proofer'
  gem 'rake'
end
{% endhighlight %}

Next, create a file called `Rakefile` in your site's root, and add the following:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'html/proofer'
task :test do
  sh "bundle exec jekyll build"
  HTML::Proofer.new("./_site").run
end
{% endhighlight %}

After that, you'll want to configure Travis by adding a `.travis.yml` file with the following contents:

{% highlight yaml %}
language: ruby
script: "rake test"
{% endhighlight %}

And finally, you need to head over to [travis-ci.org/profile](https://travis-ci.org/profile) to enable travis for your repository.

Now, each time you push, Travis is going to verify all sorts of things, like whether your images render and contain alt tags, whether your links are valid (including internal anchors), and whether all the javascript files you reference actually exist. With some additional configuration, you can have it check all sorts of things like whether [your page has a favicon](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer#favicon), or whether the [HTML is even valid](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer#html).

You can see this in action [on this site](https://travis-ci.org/benbalter/benbalter.github.com). Each time I make a change (or someone proposes one), every link and image is checked to confirm nothing broke. You'll get something that looks like:

~~~
Running ["ScriptCheck", "LinkCheck", "ImageCheck"] checks on ./_site on *.html...
Checking 1187 external links...
Ran on 120 files!
HTML-Proofer finished successfully.
~~~

And with that, you can merge confidently.

### Beyond "does this thing work?"

Having accurate links and images is a great baseline (that sadly, as I've learned through my own continuous integration, many sites don't check), but what about checking the things you *can't* see like accessability? In the case of ยง508 compliance, I wrote [Ra11y](https://github.com/benbalter/ra11y), but automated tools exist to check all sorts of things.

If you regularly author content for the web, especially if it's collaborative, I'd encourage you to take a look at what developer tools and philosophies your can coopt for your own workflows, CI or otherwise. You content deserves it.
